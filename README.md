# Christine Anne Davies Website


[View the live webiste here](https://edavies2020.github.io/MS2-CDavies/)

This website has been created to promote Christine Anne Davies Holistic Therapies business and gives full details of the therapies/services she offers. 

Christine and I discussed her requirements for the website. She provided a brief document of requirements which we discussed in more detail and I made notes: [view here](assets/images/readme/brief.pdf)

Cristine also sent over a document all about her business with Michael Davies, 'Springboard' for which there is to be an introduction to on her site: [view here](assets/images/readme/springboard.docx)

### Website Purpose

* For users to find her business and see what therapies she offers
* Inform users of her background and philosophy behind her therapies
* Give details of her therapies and services she offers including times and prices
* Show users where she is based
* Inform users of her colaberation with Michael Davies and give a brief introduction to their business 'Springboard'
 
### Key Considerations

* Professional, uncluttered and simple layout
* A feeling of calm throughout with usage of natural images
* A modern, clear font
* Text to be in black, grey or soft Technologies
* images not to be literal, but respresentative
* Springboard page to fit with rest of site but have its own identity
* Springboard page to use purple
