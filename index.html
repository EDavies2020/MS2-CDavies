                    <h3>My Journey</h3>
                    <p> I’ve worked with clients as a teacher and healer for over 20 years. I practice a number of therapies all of which work with the energy of the human body. My ‘toolbox’ includes healing, meditation and visualisation, EFT, and natural nutrition. Each therapy I use is aimed at restoring harmony and balance to body, mind, and spirit.
                        I have always been very aware of my own energy and the energy of others around me. I am also aware of the importance of our energetic connection to the natural world. From a young age I seemed to have an ability to remove pain by placing my hands on a person, but when I began healing friends and getting requests from their friends, I felt I needed to get a formal qualification and to learn more about how the process worked.
                        I also began to realise the profound effect the energy of food can have on health and began studying diet. I completed a Diploma in Natural Nutrition and using nutritional therapy is now an integral part of my healing practice. I continue to read extensively, keeping up to date with new research and developments. I have studied indigenous diets, Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, Orthomolecular Medicine and the Naturopathic movement, as well as individual dietary protocols in order to be able to provide the best support to clients wanting to improve their health. 
                        Not only I have witnessed the effectiveness of the work I do with my clients but also on a personal level. A big part of my journey was being able to heal myself and reverse the chronic disease that affected my health from early childhood. I no longer have any health problems and take no medication. This is the reason I am so passionate about my work and have such a strong belief in the therapies I use.
                        I see the human body as a violin whose strings all need to be in tune, to vibrate at the right frequency, in order to produce beautiful music. When the body is out of tune we experience discomfort and disease, in tune we feel well and are able to enjoy life to the full.
