                        <h3>My Journey</h3>
                        <p> 
                        I’ve worked with clients as a teacher and healer for over 20 years. I practice a number of therapies all of which work with the energy of the human body. My ‘toolbox’ includes healing, meditation and visualisation, EFT, and natural nutrition. Each therapy I use is aimed at restoring harmony and balance to body, mind, and spirit.
                        I have always been very aware of my own energy and the energy of others around me. I am also aware of the importance of our energetic connection to the natural world. From a young age I seemed to have an ability to remove pain by placing my hands on a person, but when I began healing friends and getting requests from their friends, I felt I needed to get a formal qualification and to learn more about how the process worked.
                        I also began to realise the profound effect the energy of food can have on health and began studying diet. I completed a Diploma in Natural Nutrition and using nutritional therapy is now an integral part of my healing practice.

                        <span class="more">    
                        I continue to read extensively, keeping up to date with new research and developments. I have studied indigenous diets, Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, Orthomolecular Medicine and the Naturopathic movement, as well as individual dietary protocols in order to be able to provide the best support to clients wanting to improve their health. 
                        Not only I have witnessed the effectiveness of the work I do with my clients but also on a personal level. A big part of my journey was being able to heal myself and reverse the chronic disease that affected my health from early childhood. I no longer have any health problems and take no medication. This is the reason I am so passionate about my work and have such a strong belief in the therapies I use.
                        I see the human body as a violin whose strings all need to be in tune, to vibrate at the right frequency, in order to produce beautiful music. When the body is out of tune we experience discomfort and disease, in tune we feel well and are able to enjoy life to the full.

                        <h3>My Philosopy</h3>
                        <h5>“Healing is a journey from fear to understanding, chaos to balance, stagnation to flow and disease to health”</h5>
                        <p> 
                        My personal philosophy of healing has evolved over many years as I’ve studied, practiced, and researched, yet it remains simple. I believe without reservation that the human system works tirelessly to heal itself, always striving to return to a state of harmony.
                        The human system, like the natural world around us relies on rhythms and cycles. A chaotic body is a sick body and restoring balance is an important part of regaining health. Like traffic jams in towns and cities, mental, emotional, or physical stagnation restricts us allowing disease to take hold. Removing blockages allows life to flow freely and effortlessly. 
                        Medical systems are set up to fight disease, not prevent it.
                        <span class="dots">...</span>
                        <span class="more">
                        When we become ill it’s easy to blame doctors for not being able to ‘fix’ our problems, but they are taught one method which is to diagnose a disease and choose a medication to suppress it or undertake surgery to repair or remove damaged tissues. 
                        Medication and surgery don’t change the circumstances that led to the disease developing in the first place. Understanding how disease develops removes the fear which is a barrier to progress. The reversal of disease begins with active engagement in learning how we can restore our health rather than expecting others to do it for us.
                        Unlocking the body’s own innate healing ability and providing the materials it needs for repair, is the only way to achieve lasting health. Experience has shown me that the intention to heal combined with good nutrition and energy based therapies can unlock that potential and I feel privileged to work with patients who are ready to embrace change so that healing can begin.
