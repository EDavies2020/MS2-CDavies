            <h5>Did you wake up this morning full of energy and enthusiasm for the day ahead? Do you have a clear direction in life, know where you are going and how you are going to get there?
                No?... Maybe Springboard can help!</h5>
            <p>Springboard offers a starting point for those wanting to improve their lives physically, mentally and spiritually. Run by two health practitioners with many years’ experience, and expertise in a variety of therapies, we aim to give participants at our weekend workshops a gentle and supportive introduction to the simple ways in which they can begin to turn their lives around.</p>
            <p>Our passion is to help people achieve their health goals. We limit our weekends to a small number of participants to make sure that everyone gets the personal attention they need. Each weekend is tailored to provide information, interaction, strategies, and techniques to take away and use.</p> 
            <p>Our location in the beautiful Welsh countryside, together with delicious healthy home cooked food, ensures that this will be a tranquil and relaxing experience that will allow everyone to unwind and get the maximum benefit from the time spent with us.</p>
