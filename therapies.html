                <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> I’ve worked with clients as a teacher and healer for over 20 years. I practice a number of therapies all of which work with the energy of the human body.<br>
                My ‘toolbox’ includes healing, meditation and visualisation, EFT, and natural nutrition. Each therapy I use is aimed at restoring harmony and balance to body, mind, and spirit. <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>

                                        <p>I think of nutrition as another energy therapy. This has nothing to do with calories, but because the food we eat should contain the life energy that nourishes our bodies and ensures that we remain in good health rather than succumb to disease.</p> 
                                        <p>Whilst we all realise that a diet full of ‘junk food’ is no good for anyone’s health, diet is not a one size fits all approach.</p>
                                        <p>It’s important to understand that the foods that create vibrant health for one person may not necessarily be suitable for another and can even be the cause of disease.</p>
                                        <p>People come to me for nutritional advice for many reasons. Many want to resolve digestive issues, allergies, or intolerances but increasingly people are seeking help to control the symptoms of chronic illness, degenerative diseases, and autoimmune conditions.</p>
                                        <p>A good diet is one of the first steps to  healing any disease.</p>
                                        <p>After taking a full history I provide clients with a diet, specifically tailored to meet their needs, together with supplements and a range of techniques and lifestyle adjustments that will support them in addressing their health problems.</p> 
                                        <p>As they go through the process of change, I adjust their programme, always bearing in mind that their bodies need be gently supported as they heal.</p>

                                        I find this a simple but effective therapy for many clients which can be used alone or to support other treatments.<br>
                                        Based on the Chinese medicine, meridian system, Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) is a simple treatment where the fingertips are used to tap on acupuncture points in a specific sequence.<br> 
                                        It is usually used to resolve physical pain as well as emotional issues and stress. It has been found effective in improving PTSD.<br>
                                        The concept behind EFT is similar to that of hands on healing in that its goal is to release blockages in the energy pathways and re-balance the energy flow of the body. With EFT clients participate in the process, which some people prefer.<br> 
                                        During a treatment I work with the client to identify the issue they want to resolve and establish the intensity level.<br> 
                                        Together we create a phrase which identifies the issue and then I guide them through the tapping sequence, followed by an evaluation of the reduction of intensity.

                                        I have practiced meditation for the last 20 years as well as teaching a variety of different meditation techniques in healing circles as well as in schools.<br> 
                                        I have found it invaluable in helping people to reduce stress, control pain and cope with a variety of situations in their lives.<br> 
                                        Many people learn meditation in order to incorporate it as a daily practice, to help them to achieve a better work life balance, improve focus, reduce stress, or achieve other goals.<br>
                                        I work closely with clients to identify which techniques are best suited to their individual needs, preferences, and desired outcome.<br> 
                                        These may include breathing techniques, mindfulness, body scanning, meditating on sounds or objects, guided meditation, or visualisation.<br>
                                        Helping clients to establish the right kind of meditative practice can be a powerful tool for healing.

                                        Despite modern technology, hands on healing is just as relevant today as it was centuries ago. It acts on the energy field of living things, known as the Biofield.<br> 
                                        Obstructions to the flow of energy in and around the body causes symptoms of dis-ease which can result in illness. Healing restores the flow of energy and stimulates the body to move back into balance.<br> 
                                        It is gentle, non-invasive and can be safely used alongside any other treatment, alternative or conventional.<br> 
                                        I have witnessed its effects on many levels. Treatments create a sense of calm, often relieving the stress and the fear associated with illness. Release of congested energy can improve pain.<br> 
                                        Buried emotions can surface and be released. Feelings of being stuck and unable to move forward in life can resolve.<br>
                                        I am able to feel, and sometimes see, this energy and identify areas where energy is low or blocked. This enables me to support my clients more effectively.<br> 
                                        I also send distant healing and teach self-healing techniques.
